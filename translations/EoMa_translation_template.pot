They tirelessly preserve the accumulated learning in the face of catastrophic decline to avoid it getting lost to the sands of time.\n"

"Hidden away in remote canyons, the Lorekepers maintain a labyrinthine repository of ancient texts, meticulously transcribed onto scrolls or carved into stone tablets. It is rumored that this secret library is nestled somewhere deep within the craggy depths of the Great Wasteland, containing untold secrets and knowledge that most nations can only dream of. According to legends, the library does not have an entrance, and instead the only way to reach it is via the rare art of teleportation magic which the Loreekeepers have mastered.\n"

Such roc riders often end up being leaders of small roc rider gangs, flying around empty territories and preying on the infrequent lone travelers, and attacking poorly-guarded caravans. They also often bring handmade bows with them into battle. While the bows' low quality makes them nowhere near being fit for use on the ground, their arrows become quite deadly when shot from the sky, thanks to the vertical acceleration from falling."

Thanks to these powerful weapons they were capable of killing any kind of armored foe with just one strike. But sadly for Atokpi, their best warriors were not as effective as expected against undead swarms. Destroyers tried to equip the doom spears but none of their undead Atokpis were able to even carry one of these incredible weapons, that is why they just equipped the shorter but more portable version of Yari, typically used by novices. Crimson Atokpis, albeit smaller that their samurai counterparts, are very agile and will try to find and assault weak spots in enemy defense lines, allowing the undead swarm to destroy even the most fortified targets from behind."

One fateful day, one such mirror was stolen by cunning Mystic Warrior with the intent of selling it on a black market to pay off some debts he accrued. Before he could stash the mirror, he was summoned on an expedition, during which he faced a life-or-death situation. When his leader was attacked and almost killed by enemy mages, the warrior acted swiftly, pulling out the mirror from his backpack and using it to protect himself and his comrades. The mirror's defensive capabilities proved crucial, repelling the attackers and saving the group from certain doom.\n"

Instead, the Guru intervened on the warrior's behalf, pardoning him, paying off his debts and granting him permission to keep the mirror as a memento. From this encounter, the Mirrorshield Division was born – a specialized unit equipped with specially crafted reinforced mirrors that combine magic-deflecting properties with formidable melee weapons. These elite warriors are sent on the most dangerous expeditions, and their unique arsenal gives them a major advantage against powerful magic-using foes."

Others are masters of desert combat, trained to fight in the scorching heat of the sun and armed with wrist blades and throwing knives dipped in poison.
