    description= _ "Tharis warriors who have proven themselves through bravery and leadership are often promoted to the rank of Dark Commander, exchanging their enchanted daggers for spears imbued with fire magic. These powerful individuals stand at least a head taller than their comrades, with broad shoulders and imposing physiques that command respect. Despite their fearsome appearance, however, Dark Commanders are known for their calm and collected demeanor on the battlefield, inspiring their followers with their confidence and authority.

In addition to their prowess in melee combat, Dark Commanders possess a limited ability to wield basic fire magic. While they may not be adept at casting spells, they can still harness the power of flames to devastating effect by imbuing their spears with fiery energy unleashing explosive bursts of heat upon their enemies. With training and practice, they might even develop greater control over this aspect of their powers, becoming truly formidable mages on the battlefield."
