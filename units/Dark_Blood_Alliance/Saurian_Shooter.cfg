    description= _ "Saurians are very small of frame, and though they are somewhat frail because of this, they are very, very agile. In combat, their size allows them to dart past defenses that would hold any grown man at bay, making them a tricky foe to deal with.

While most saurian soldiers choose to use spears, others prefer light ranged weapons, usually blowguns with poisoned darts. Their weaponry combined with their agility is something that shouldn't be underestimated."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
