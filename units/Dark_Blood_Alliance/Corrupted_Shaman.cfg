    description= _ "Some of the Dark Blood Shamans get corrupted. By who, or what, nobody knows, but it makes them exchange their Water Magic for that of its polar opposite - Fire. They lose their healing abilities, but they don’t seem to care, as they say that Fire is inherently superior to Water.
Whatever corrupts them changes their personalities, too, making them selfish and cruel. As a result, they are shunned from their tribes, which exile them to the heart of the Great Bog. Forced to wander the Bog for years, they usually make their way out and hire themselves to some of the morally bankrupt tribes."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
