These majestic beasts of prey, which are said to be the offspring of the great Dragons of old, are captured by the Dark Blood saurians, which use them as shock troopers of sorts. They are subjected to torture by fire, making them even more crazed and bloodthirsty than Nature intended, and released upon the Tribeâ€™s multiple enemies."
