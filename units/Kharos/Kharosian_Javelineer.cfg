    description= _ "Not all Kharosians can afford expensive shields used by elite troops. That is why some of them decide to specialize in throwing light spears to decimate their foes. This traditional way of fighting dates back to ancient times, when Kharos lands were divided among many different tribes and cults constantly waging domination wars against each other. One of such tribes was particularly known for its fierce javelineers wrecking havoc on their enemies. Nowadays Kharosian armies often consist of multiple squads of Javelineers and more experienced Impalers to gain the upper hand in any battle."
