Two centuries later and these lumbering beasts have flourished, growing in both strength and number. Some say that it was a strange magic which bound the cyclopes to their new allegiance and is perhaps a reason for their increased power. One thing about these beasts is a certainty: when facing one in combat it is best not to get hit."

It took one particularly mad and foolhardy goblin to change the fate of his people when he set out to tame the beasts. After several narrow escapes the goblin managed to steal an egg from the great birds and rose it under his care. Less than three months later when the Rocs attacked they were surprised to hear a piercing cry from above and even more surprised when they were ripped to shreds by one of their own. To this day the goblins ride tamed Rocs into battle, their battle cries the only warning of impending doom."

As the name implies, they originate from a dimension called the Abyss - a place full of primitive chaos, both creative and destructive in nature, where concepts like space and time can be rather difficult to apply. Initially, their bodies are shapeless clumps of energy due to the Abyss's nature, but once summoned to the mortal world, they change their form to either become living manifestations of elements, or become humanoid in appearance. The latter are technically not-living, and thus do not age, are not susceptible to any ailment, and damage to their bodies heals quite quickly."
