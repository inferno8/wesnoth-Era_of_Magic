    description=_"Innovative magic mirrors are a hallmark of the Sky Kingdom, capable of absorbing and deflecting magical spells. One fateful day, one such mirror was stolen by cunning Mystic Warrior with the intent of selling it on a black market to pay off some debts he accrued. Before he could stash the mirror, he was summoned on an expedition, during which he faced a life-or-death situation. When his leader was attacked and almost killed by enemy mages, the warrior acted swiftly, pulling out the mirror from his backpack and using it to protect himself and his comrades. The mirror's defensive capabilities proved crucial, repelling the attackers and saving the group from certain doom.

The warrior's bravery and quick thinking earned him a reprieve from the Master Council, who otherwise would have punished him for stealing the valuable artifact. Instead, the Guru intervened on the warrior's behalf, pardoning him, paying off his debts and granting him permission to keep the mirror as a memento. From this encounter, the Mirrorshield Division was born – a specialized unit equipped with specially crafted reinforced mirrors that combine magic-deflecting properties with formidable melee weapons. These elite warriors are sent on the most dangerous expeditions, and their unique arsenal gives them a major advantage against powerful magic-using foes."
    #original suggested description (written by ForestDragon, but was too long for the help menu, so the shortened version above was used instead):

    #One of the Sky Kingdom's many innovative creations is the magical mirror. More than just any regular light-reflecting material, such a mirror can absorb and #even outright deflect magical spells. These fascinating objects used to be mainly relegated to just being used for magic experiment and were rarely #produced, but that changed on one fateful day.
    #
    #It was morning, a cunning Mystic Warrior was almost alone guarding a magical mirror research site. After working there for weeks, and having had financial #problems due to debt, he saw an opportunity - discreetly steal one mirror, and sell it on one of the surface-dwelling nations' black markets when the #floating islands reach land.
    #
    #Less than an hour after he took the mirror and wrapped it in some cloth, he and other Hidden Faces and Mystic Warriors guarding the site were summoned on an #urgent military expedition. With no time to stash the mirror elsewhere, he put it in his backpack and departed the islands alongside the rest of the #expedition squad led by a War Mage.
    #
    #Some time later, during the expedition, the leader the Mystic Warrior and a few others got seperated from the rest of the squad and were being quickly #approached by a squad of enemy mages, with not enough time for sky kingdom reinforcements to arrive. Faced with the imminent threat in front of him, the #Mystic Warrior has a sudden idea - he opens his backpack, and quickly pulls out and unwraps the mirror.
    #
    #Shortly after that, the enemy mages launched a barrage of spells at the War Mage. It seemed like the leader was about to meet his demise, however, just #barely in time, the Mystic Warrior jumped between the war mage and his foes with mirror in hand.
    #
    #Not only did both survive the concentrated volley of spells, but the mirror's deflected spells also managed to wound the same enemy mages who cast them, #enough to let the other members of the leader's squad quickly finish off the ambushers.
    #
    #After reuniting with the rest of the squad and finishing the expedition, upon their return home it did not take long for the theft of the mirror to become #known to the Master Council. Although the Council wanted to punish the mystic warrior for his crime, the war mage told Guru about how the warrior's actions #actually saved his life and even the expedition itself.
    #
    #Seeing the warrior's valor and ingenuity, the Guru approached the warrior, and decided to pardon him, paid off his debts out of his own pocket, and even let #him keep the mirror. Instead of selling the mirror as originally planned, the warrior ended up keeping it as a memento. Weeks passed, Guru has increased the #mirror research site's funding, and then officially formed the 'Mirrorshield Division' with the mystic warrior as its first member and leader.
    #
    #Mirroshields' weapon of choice is a heavily modified version of the original mirrors, reinforced to be able to withstand physical impact while still #retaining their magic-deflecting properties, and also usable as a decent melee weapon. Producing them is still an expensive process, so the Mirrorshield #Division is only deployed in very dangerous expeditions where there is a need to deal with powerful magic users.
