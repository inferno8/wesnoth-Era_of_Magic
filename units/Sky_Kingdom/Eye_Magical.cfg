    description= _ "Magical Eyes are a breed of flying constructs made out of magical energy contained inside metal shells via magnetic force. They can make microscopic gaps in the shell to release concentrated beams of such energy at their opponents. They are manufactured in special workshops scattered throughout the kingdom. Their shells are made out of an unusual metal, which is slightly lighter than even the air itself, but is rather fragile. They are occasionally known to be used like carrier pigeons, delivering messages and small objects when Air Magi are unavailable."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_ARCANE}
