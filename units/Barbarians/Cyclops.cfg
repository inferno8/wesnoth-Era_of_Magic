    description= _ "Cumbersome and lacking fine intellect, the Cyclops race had been driven near to extinction before becoming a part of the barbarian horde. Two centuries later and these lumbering beasts have flourished, growing in both strength and number. Some say that it was a strange magic which bound the cyclopes to their new allegiance and is perhaps a reason for their increased power. One thing about these beasts is a certainty: when facing one in combat it is best not to get hit."
