    description=_"Veteran roc riders are an uncommon sight, as many either end up dying during skirmishes or don't see much action beyond scouting, but there are noteworthy exceptions. Such roc riders often end up being leaders of small roc rider gangs, flying around empty territories and preying on the infrequent lone travelers, and attacking poorly-guarded caravans. They also often bring handmade bows with them into battle. While the bows' low quality makes them nowhere near being fit for use on the ground, their arrows become quite deadly when shot from the sky, thanks to the vertical acceleration from falling."
