    description= _ "Whereas most rune adepts are contented to work as subordinates in most industries, using their skills to maintain existing runic equipment or complete simple tasks where power and efficiency of the glyphs is of lesser concern, some have ambition and skills to learn more and after years of efforts may earn title of a runesmith - a skilled craftsman, capable of enhancing equipment with permanent runes embed in their structure and able to run a forge all their own.

Should the situation call for arms, licensed runesmiths are highly valued warriors, for refinement in their craft allows them to break enemy strongpoints with frightening efficiency."
