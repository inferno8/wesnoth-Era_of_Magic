    description= _ "Since ancient times, the dwarves have practiced magic in the form of runecraft - patterns carved in rock or metal, capable of binding and releasing magical energies. This art has since become fundamental to functioning of their society, from creation of the most renowned weapons and armours to processes as mundane as controlling heat of the forges, running steam engines or keeping the brews cold.

Rune adepts are the lowest ranking among those who found their calling with enchanted hammer in hand, and while important in civilian roles, they also make up a vital part of dwarvish militias as siege specialists - using the same runes to burn or freeze even heavily entrenched enemies."
