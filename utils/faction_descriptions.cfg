#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_SKYKINGDOM
_"The Sky Kingdom is a mysterious realm of powerful mages who dwell on majestic floating islands that drift across the skies like celestial behemoths. These aerial cities are said to be imbued with powerful magic, allowing them to navigate through the upper atmosphere with ease. From up high, the Sky Mages have a panoramic view of the world below, observing and trading with other nations as they soar across the skies.

While the Sky Kingdom is renowned for its groundbreaking scientific advancements, it remains tight-lipped about its true intentions and goals. Some say the mages are driven by a quest for knowledge, while others speculate that they seek to unlock hidden secrets of the universe. Whatever their motivations, the Sky Kingdom's obsession with scientific progress has earned them a reputation as one of the most sophisticated societies on the planet."#enddef

Their ancestors made a groundbreaking discovery - the Abyss, a mystical realm teeming with boundless energy, hidden at the very core of the desert. This mysterious domain held the secret to harnessing unfathomable might. Thanks to intricate magical circles developed by their forebears, the Summoners were able to tap into the Abyss' increadible potential and invoke powerful elemental beings and enigmatic entities from the depths of the realm. These relentless dwellers of the Abyss have proven to be fiercely loyal to the Summoners, granting them the ability to fulfil their deepest desires.

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_THARIS
_"The cruel warlords and sovereigns of the East, the Tharis, are direct descendants of an ancient tribe that had long practiced dark magic. This ancient lineage has left an indelible mark on their physical appearance, as well as their minds, which have been twisted by their devotion to the Great Destroyers - mysterious, legendary undead beings who are believed to hold the power to bring about the end of the world. The Tharis believe that by sacrificing other nations and cultures, they will be granted immunity from the Great Destroyers when they return in the foreseeable future. At the heart of their cult is an enigmatic artifact known as the Eye of Darkness, said to grant its possessor unparalleled power over the forces of darkness.

The Tharis are renowned for their mastery of arcane arts, capable of casting spells that few others can even comprehend, let alone replicate. Their warlocks are feared across the land for their cunning and ruthlessness, and their armies are comprised of the most elite soldiers, trained to fight without mercy or remorse. The Tharis see themselves as the chosen ones, destined to usher in a new era of darkness and destruction upon the world."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_KHAROS
_"Kharos is a serene and harmonious society united under the revered deity of the Sun. As direct descendants of the ancient Sun Cult, the Kharosians possess a profound connection to the divine that manifests in their mastery of light magic. This mystical power is channeled through the Sun Ray, an enigmatic and powerful relic from the distant past. The Sun Ray grants Kharosians the ability to swiftly heal injuries and even teleport short distances.

As a society, Kharos is deeply devoted to the Sun and its life-giving power. Agriculture played a significant role in the development of their faith, as the Sun was essential to their crops and sustenance. Over time, various clans and tribes existed within Kharos, but eventually, one emerged victorious in regional conflicts, uniting them under the Light of the Sun. This unification formed the modern-day civilization known as Kharos.

Today, Kharos remains a unified society bound together by their devotion to the Sun. Their mastery of light magic allows them to harness the power of the Sun for various purposes, including healing, transportation, and protection. The Sun Ray serves as a symbol of their connection to the divine and is highly revered throughout their society. Through their harmony with nature and each other, the Kharosians have built a thriving civilization dedicated to the pursuit of peace, prosperity, and spiritual growth."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_BARBARIANS
_"Southwest of the Great Desert are barren wastelands - a harsh, unforgiving land, yet which is home for many different creatures: Tiny goblins, barbaric orcs, mysterious trolls and even mighty cyclopes. They originally were independent and constantly fought for survival, but recently, something made them unite against the Darkblooded, forming the so-called 'Great Horde'. It could be due to the Jungle of Life's vast resources, it could be due to some old grudge, it could be something entirely else..."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_DARKBLOOD
_"At the edge of the Great Desert lies the mystical Jungle of Life - home to one of the oldest and most enigmatic civilizations in the world, the Darkblooded. Sneaky salamanders, majestic wyverns, gigantic toads, and lizard clans coexist in this verdant paradise, each contributing their unique strengths to the delicate balance of life within the jungle. However, beyond the safety of the jungle's embrace, a dark and foreboding landscape beckons. Known as the Great Bog, this treacherous expanse is home to twisted shamans and other outcast creatures who worship chaos and revel in the desecration of life. These malevolent beings plot their evil deeds, threatening to unleash their depravity upon everyone daring to venture into their territory."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_RUNEMASTERS
_"In days of yore, a majestic civilization known as Runemasters flourished at the Northern Pole. Hidden away from the rest of the world, they harnessed the power of magical crystals present in the area to fuel their technological marvels – steam-powered robots, armored tanks, and even aerial mechanical beasts resembling dragons. These enigmatic artisans were the final holdouts against the relentless onslaught of the Destroyers, a merciless undead horde bent on laying waste to all living things. Despite valiant resistance, the Runemasters suffered heavy losses, leaving them on the brink of extinction. Yet, their inventions continue to operate, vigilantly guarding their ancestral domains to this day."#enddef

#define EOMA_FACTION_DESCR_DESTROYERS
_"Little is known about these powerful undead beings, feared for their unwavering destructive power. Fueled by the corrosive force of anti-magic, they consist of the remnants of long-forgotten civilizations, once consumed by the chaotic swarm. The origins of the Destroyers date back to a distant past, when they may have been crafted as a weapon gone haywire, causing the cataclysmic event that brought near-extinction to all life on the planet, leaving only a few scattered survivors. Although the majority of these monstrosities were vanquished by the Runemasters, their lingering essences continue to haunt the frigid wastes of the North Pole. It's rumored that these beings are the same ones the Tharis worship."#enddef
